    question: "What makes NOVE bags different from traditional luxury brands?",
    answer: "NOVE focuses on 'Liquid Glass' aesthetics — a design philosophy where structure and fluidity meet. We use high-grade organic eucalyptus leather and reinforced plant-based polymers to create bags that are incredibly durable, sustainable, and lightweight."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you ship internationally?",
    answer: "Yes, NOVE offers concierge shipping to over 40 countries. Delivery times vary between 4-10 business days for international orders, with all taxes and duties prepaid for a seamless experience."
  },
  {
    question: "What is your return policy?",
    answer: "We offer a 14-day complimentary returns policy for all unworn masterpieces in their original packaging. Each bag comes with a digital authenticity certificate which must remain unassigned for the return to be processed."
  },
  {
    question: "Is the eucalyptus leather real leather?",
    answer: "It is a bio-based, vegan alternative that outperforms traditional leather in durability and weight-to-strength ratio. It is 100% cruelty-free and crafted from sustainably harvested eucalyptus fibers."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I care for my NOVE bag?",
    answer: "Our composite finishes are highly resistant. For daily care, simply wipe with the microfiber cloth included in your museum box. Avoid prolonged exposure to direct high heat or sharp abrasive surfaces."
